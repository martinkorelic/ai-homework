# Company category classifier

For analytical purposes, we want to categorize company names into one of predefined categories. Develop a classifier to categorize unlabeled companies into predefined categories.

Below is a sample table of company names with their respective categories:
| Company    | Category |
| -------- | ------- |
| Wal-Mart Stores	  | Retailing    |
| Royal Dutch/Shell Group    | Oil & gas operations    |
| General Electric    | Conglomerates    |
| American Intl Group | Insurance     |
| Bank of America    | Banking    |

## Tasks
- Create a model that will classify unlabeled company names into their respective category
- Provide a report how your model performs on the labeled dataset

## Directions
- You can use any programming language/framework
- You can use any of the existing models, APIs
    - If you need any access tokens or API keys, let us know, and we will provide them if necessary
- The labeled dataset of Forbes 2000 biggest companies is available at `resources/dataset.csv`
- A list of 27 predefined categories is available at `resources/categories.csv`

## Submission
