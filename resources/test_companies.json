The history of Popular Canada was marked with a line-up of successful publications, beginning with MathSmart published in May 1999. It became an instant success and more than 200,000 copies have been sold since its launch. Since then, Popular Canada has been constantly improving and expanding its product range. Riding on the success of MathSmart, it strengthened its Math products by publishing MathSmart Problem-Solving and MathSmart Skills Builder. 2001 saw the launch of its anchor series, Complete MathSmart, which became a perennial bestseller across Canada. On top of the Math workbooks, Popular Canada started publishing English workbooks in 2001 with the EnglishSmart series and later the EnglishSmart Grammar series. Both series, like the Math workbooks, were well-received, which led to the publishing of Complete EnglishSmart in 2003. Complete MathSmart and Complete EnglishSmart have since continued to be bestselling workbook series in Canada year after year, along with Complete Canadian Curriculum, our signature series first published in 2007. To date, these anchor series have sold more than 3 million copies combined. In 2009, we started publishing French workbooks, and now the Complete FrenchSmart series has become yet another of our anchor series. Today, our reach has gone beyond Canada, with schools and individuals in as far-off countries and places as China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Jordan, Germany, Denmark, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Italy, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico choosing our Smart workbooks as supplementary learning resources for their children.",

    "description": "It is our sincere pleasure to share with you Commonwealth Bank’s history that underscores our five decades of unparalleled growth, financial accomplishments and tradition of service excellence, beginning with those very first modest steps on Wednesday, April 20th, 1960. Conceived as a small consumer finance company by the late Sir Roland Symonette, The Bahamas’ first premier and his partner Peter Paul Saunders, former head of the Canadian Laurentide Financial Corporation, Commonwealth Industrial Bank began as a single desk operation with three employees. Bahamian Earle Sands was recruited as the first head of this new enterprise along with Lionel Albury and Juanita Grant. The Bank’s initial clients represented the accounts receivable, acquired from the Home Furniture Company. This new venture, which continued to operate as a subsidiary of Canadian-based Laurentide Financial Corporation Limited, quickly filled a financing void created by the big multinational banks; by making available an alternative avenue for the average Bahamian wage earner to have access to financing for furniture, home improvement, travel and other consumer needs. Although the Bank looks vastly different from its humble beginnings, it is our commitment to our founding values that allows us to continue to perform at a level that places us among the best and highest performing banks in the country. Not only do we measure performance in financial goals but also in our pledge to assist our communities, whether it be in the aftermath of a hurricane, lending support to our education system or helping our customers affected by the economic downturn. Thank you for choosing Commonwealth Bank as your financial partner.",

With more than 40,000 unique products, we're the nation's largest direct retailer of value-priced party supplies, toys and crafts as well as a leading provider of fundraising products. Headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, Oriental Trading has continued its long-standing commitment to excellent customer service, even being recognized by Foresee as one of the Top 20 Internet Retailers based on customer satisfaction. Additionally, Oriental Trading has been rated one of the Top 100 Online Retailers by Internet Retailer. Our history with fun is one that spans for the better part of the last century. Founded in 1932, we became a major supplier of novelties to the U.S. carnival trade in the 1950s before expanding in the succeeding decades through catalogs, direct marketing and eventually the internet in 1999. In 2012, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway saw tremendous value and growth opportunity in Oriental Trading and made the decision to purchase our company. Shortly after, Oriental Trading acquired two companies that aligned with our mission: MindWare, a manufacturer, wholesaler and direct retailer of “brainy toys for kids of all ages,” and SmileMakers, a leading brand specializing in patient giveaways and promotion products for dental and healthcare markets. To better meet the needs of our customers, Oriental Trading created several new brands in 2017; Marry Me, Fun365, and CustomFun365. For over 85 years, we've helped friends and families around the world spark imaginations and celebrate special moments. Spreading fun one smile at a time? That's our specialty!

Our mission revolves around transforming lives, one delightful shake or bite at a time, and we're proud to have served millions of individuals. Our journey at Simple Again began over 15 years ago, evolving from our initial inception. Founded by Dan Young, our story started with Performance Food Centers (PFC) in 1999, aiming to introduce natural, whole-food nutrition to the fitness community. Dan's personal experience of overcoming illness through whole-food discoveries inspired our commitment to educate others about maintaining health through proper nutrition. Initially supplying one juice bar and then expanding to more, we realized the misconceptions surrounding nutrition. Amidst this realization, we found that nutrition should not be complex—it can be simplified by filtering out the noise and misinformation. That's precisely what we did; we became that essential filter. Today, Dan remains healthy, and we've helped countless individuals, just like you, in achieving better health: Through PFC, we've facilitated the establishment of thriving Juice Bars across the country, offering a variety of natural products to support health, wellness, and performance goals. With swiig (Stuff with Infinite Goodness), we've made these products accessible for everyone, anytime, anywhere! Our dedication lies in making nutrition and good health accessible and straightforward—this is what makes us proudly advocate for making nutrition...Simple Again!",

    "description": "In 1899, Charles F. Kerbeck, patriarch of the Kerbeck family and grandfather of the three Kerbeck brothers who are the present day owners, began bringing his dream of providing quality transportation to the growing Philadelphia-area population. Horse drawn carriages evolved into coaches powered by gasoline engines, which evolved into automobiles. Over 100 years later, the Kerbeck dealerships are among the most prominent and successful in America, with 16 highly successful franchises, 12 different brands and six separate showrooms. It is, unquestionably, one of the great American success stories. In the early 1920’s, Frank C. Kerbeck continued in his father’s tradition by opening an automobile dealership in Philadelphia. In the early 60’s, as the population spread outside of the city, Kerbeck opened what was at that time a very large showroom on Route 73 in Palmyra, N.J. at the foot of the Tacony Palmyra Bridge. He named this new establishment F.C. Kerbeck & Sons and began a unique marketing plan: selling pre-owned Cadillacs exclusively. After Kerbeck passed away in 1968, his wife Jennie along with his eldest son Charles, operated the dealership. Shortly thereafter, Charles’ two younger brothers, George and Frank, joined the business and the company began developing into the mega-dealership of today. In the late 1970s, the Kerbecks foresaw an exciting opportunity and expanded into Atlantic City. They began growing, earning the respect of manufacturers and aligning themselves with General Motors, they were awarded highly coveted franchises for Cadillac, Chevrolet and Pontiac. To meet the increasing demand another large operation in Pleasantville NJ was added where they earned franchises for Subaru and Mitsubishi. At the dealership in Palmyra NJ where it all started, luxury car franchises were awarded by Rolls Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini, Maserati, and Aston Martin. On the domestic front, Buick and GMC were added to the pre-owned Cadillac and Lincoln division.",
