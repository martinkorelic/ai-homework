    "description": "Working at Westpac Group means you are part of a family and that doesn’t stop just because employees might leave or move onto other challenges. The National Westpac Group Alumni provides an opportunity for retired, resigned or retrenched former Australian-based salaried employees of Westpac Group (including brands Westpac, St.George, BT, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA as well as de-registered entities The Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd, Bank of NSW and Challenge Bank) to continue to access a range of employee benefits for themselves and their families and to also come together for social purposes and enjoy the fellowship of former colleagues. A national member newsletter and a presence across multiple social media channels also keeps you up to date on all things ‘Alumni’. The original Westpac Retired Officers’ Club (WROC) had its origins in the 1960s when retired and past Bank Managers of the Bank of NSW formed a Club to provide opportunities for everyone to come together after retirement. When the Wales merged with Commercial Bank of Australia in the 80s, members of their Retired Officers Club were invited to join WROC. So many years on, those original Bank of NSW retiree members would not have imagined the current era of employment flexibility and empowered workers that the Bank has today. With representation across Australia, the Westpac Group Alumni provides opportunities for former employees of all ages to remain connected. For those interested and who enjoy a sense of community, our state branches hold regular luncheons and other social activities, which are very popular with our members coming from such diverse backgrounds and varied experiences across their careers and personal journeys. If you are a former employee and wish to join the Westpac Group Alumni, a one-off nominal membership joining admin fee applies. If you would like more information, please visit our website.",

    "description": "Founded in 1886 with Hong Kong as its base, The Wharf (Holdings) Limited (Stock code: 0004) is the 17th company incorporated in Hong Kong and a premier company with a long history. As one of the 30 constituent stocks in the original Hang Seng Index since more than 50 years ago, Wharf is among the top local blue chips that is most actively traded and widely held. Backed by a long standing mission of Building for Tomorrow and a proven track record in management and execution, the Group has produced consistent and productive performance over the years. Subsequent to the separate listing of Wharf Real Estate Investment Company Limited in November 2017 which focuses on its Hong Kong investment properties portfolio, The Wharf (Holdings) Limited's businesses are largely property-related, comprising Investment Properties, Hotels and Development Properties in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Other businesses include Logistics through Modern Terminals and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. Wharf's Peak Portfolio redefines the concept of luxury living with a collection of the rare and most prestigious residences, epitomising a unique and exclusive lifestyle at the most sought-after addresses in town. Besides the highly-acclaimed Mount Nicholson, other properties under development include 1 Plantation Road, 11 Plantation Road and 77 Peak Road. Besides The Peak Portfolio, the development pipeline of Hong Kong Properties also includes the Kowloon Tong Residential Project and projects in Kowloon East. In the Mainland, Wharf spearheads its investment properties with the International Finance Square (IFS) series at the very heart of CBD or new CBD in high potential cities including Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Suzhou and Wuxi. IFS developments are positioned as trendsetting landmarks with unrivalled locations, superior planning and design, retailer and shopper critical mass, as well as top-notch retail management. Changsha IFS, 2018's newest to the collection, and Chengdu IFS opened in 2014 are comparable to Harbour City in Hong Kong in scale and prominence. The boutique Chongqing IFS, featuring the largest cluster of first-tier brands in Chongqing, was opened in 2017. The Group continues to adopt a selective land acquisition policy with strategic focus on key Tier 1 or 2 cities in order to secure high quality land bank with returns. The development property landbank at the end of June 2019 totalled 3.6 million square metres. Wharf Hotels manages an expanding portfolio of 17 hotels in Asia, spearheaded by a prominent Niccolo brand in recent years. The Wharf Hotels owns four contemporary, urban, chic Niccolo hotels (including The Murray, Hong Kong and Niccolo Changsha) and manages 13 Marco Polo hotels in Hong Kong, Mainland China and the Philippines. Niccolo Suzhou is the newest addition under development and is scheduled to open in 2021. The Group also owns and operates Modern Terminals and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, key components in Hong Kong's success as a hub for international trade and international transportation for decades. CME2 is the Group's long-term investment, representing a strategic initiative of reinvesting capital and profit released from the CME1 exit in Hong Kong in a progressive new economy infrastructure CME2 arena that covers much larger markets with greater growth potential. Building for Tomorrow also extends to Wharf's Business-in-Community (BIC) pursuit. With the flagship school improvement programme Project Wecan growing from strength to strength, the Group supports a series of BIC initiatives including Wu Zhi Qiao (Bridge to China) Charitable Foundation, Shanghai International Tower-running Grand Prix and Operation Panda with an aim of promoting BIC and to bring benefits to different segments of society.",

Joy is about discovery and experimentation, moments big and small. It can be anything from a single instant to a life-defining experience; a rush of emotion or a huge event. Our products create, amplify and share those moments – whatever they may be. Spontaneous and ever-changing, ‘now’ is the instant where all of this joy occurs. It’s every moment of life, every burst of laughter and every flash of wonder. It’s where we explore and engage with each other and the world around us. So always, enjoy.now",

DuPont Columbia University Award for its coverage of the 2013 restaurant explosion and fire at a landmark restaurant in a historic Kansas City shopping district. This coverage also won a regional Emmy Award. KSHB was named Station of the Year in 2012 by the Kansas City Press Club. In 2014, KSHB won three regional Edward R. Murrow Awards and was named the Business Philanthropist of the Year. The station began operating in 1970. Scripps bought the station in 1977 and in 1981 changed the call letters to KSHB, standing for Scripps Howard Broadcasting. If you’re not familiar with the Greater Kansas City metro area, what you’ll find may surprise you – a vibrant city and flourishing suburban communities, rolling hills and tree-lined boulevards, a thriving economy driven by thousands of small businesses, tech start-ups, medical research, and headquarters of companies like Hallmark and Sprint. Ours is a community of good schools, cultural amenities, acclaimed dining (particularly our BBQ) and affordable living. Most importantly, it’s a community with a heart – friendly, easy-going, and forward-thinking. That's why Kiplinger Magazine and other publications have rated Kansas City as one of the 50 Smart Places to Live! With more than 200 fountains trickled throughout the city, it’s no surprise that KC has earned the nickname, “The City of Fountains.” An array of arts includes the Kansas City Symphony, Opera and Ballet and the nationally recognized Nelson Atkins Art Museum. Kansas City residents also participate in an active professional sports scene that includes the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Royals, Sporting Kansas City, and the Missouri Mavericks to name a few. At last count, we had 12 professional sports teams plus NASCAR. We’re also wild about college sports in this town.",

To help fill Indiana’s need for more and better teachers, they bought the property of a defunct school in Muncie and gave it to the state. What was founded as a small teacher training college in 1918 is now a comprehensive, world-class university. We embrace the Ball family’s legacy symbolized by the iconic Beneficence statue on our campus—the enduring values of excellence, innovation, courage, integrity, inclusiveness, social responsibility, and gratitude.
